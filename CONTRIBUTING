First of all, thanks for taking the time to try and make this project 
better!  Secondly this is an optional document, if you have a small fix, 
just submit as a pull request in GitHub, or send me a patch against the 
latest released version on the GitHub issue tracker here:

 https://github.com/plicease/Archive-Libarchive-FFI/issues?state=open

I will most likely be able to shoehorn it into the idiosyncrasies of 
this project.

That being said, if you want to save me time, and speed the process, 
please do use dzil to help create and test your patch.

 - I use Dist::Zilla, so you will have to install it plus the plugins 
   that I am using, which may take a while if you aren't already using 
   it.
 
 - It isn't a pure-perl distribution, so you really do need dzil to 
   build and test (you can't just prove -l to run the tests).
   
 - Most of the tests and some code are pulled in from the 
   Archive::Libarchive::XS distribution, as part of the build/release 
   project, I've disabled the pull if your username isn't ollisg (my 
   uesr id).  Just keep in mind that part of the code base is shared.
 
 - If you are really interested, you can checkout 
   Archive::Libarchive::XS in a sybling directory and set your USER 
   environment variable to ollisg and run inc/run/before_build.pl
 
 - Some generated content is intended to be checked back into the
   repository, which is probably a confusing and bad thing long term.

I hope to refactor some of this in the future so that it is easier for 
contributors.
